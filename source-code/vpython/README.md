# VPython

VPython is a framework to create 3D animations in Python.  It can be used
to visualize physics simulations.

## What is it?

1. `pendulum.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook illustrating VPython on a non-linear frictionless
   pendulum, using scipy to solve the set of ODEs that describes it.
1. `environment.yml`: conda environment defintion requred to run the notebook.
